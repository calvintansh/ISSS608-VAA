This webpage serves as a portfolio showcasing my coursework for ISSS608: Visual Analytics and Applications at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience in using RStudio for implementing various data visualization techniques, as well as Tableau for creating interactive dashboards. I also developed an understanding of version control using GitHub and learned how to publish analytical reports and dashboards using Quarto and deploy them as a website via Netlify. This portfolio reflects the practical skills and concepts I acquired in the course.

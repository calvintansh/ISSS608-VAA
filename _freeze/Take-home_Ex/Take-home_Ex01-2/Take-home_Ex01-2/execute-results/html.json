Based on these feedbacks, I will prepare the makeover version of their data visualisation.\n\nThis page will focus on **Phase 2** of this exercise and you can find **Phase 1** in [Take-Home Exercise 1-1](https://isss608-ay2024-25t3.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01-1/take-home_ex01-1).\n\n## [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 1.1 Background\n\nA local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024.\n\nAssuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, my classmates have also been tasked to prepare at most three data visualisation for this article.\n\n## [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 1.2 Peer Learning\n\nAfter reviewing my classmates' works, I have chosen the submission by [RAJESH BABU SANTIGARI](https://isss608vaarajesh01.netlify.app/takehomeexercises/take_homeexercise1/take_homeexercise1) to review. I will have to analyse his work and identify three good design principles and three areas for further improvement. Based on these feedbacks, I have prepared the makeover version of his data visualisation to show how it can be enhanced.\n\n# [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 1.3 Preparation\n\nThe five R packages used in [Take-Home Exercise 1-1](https://isss608-ay2024-25t3.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01-1/take-home_ex01-1) were also loaded into this working R environment using the code below.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, patchwork, ggthemes, knitr, cowplot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## [1-1:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 1.4 Importing Data\n\nSimilar to [Take-Home Exercise 1-1](https://isss608-ay2024-25t3.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01-1/take-home_ex01-1), the data file called *respopagesex2024* will be used.\n\nIt consists of data about Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, categorised by a Single Year of Age and Sex,for June 2024. It is in a csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports *respopagesex2024.csv* twice, once for Rajesh's data and once for my makeover data.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nraj_data <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\")\n\nmakeover_data <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n# [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2 Visualisations\n\nFor this section, I will display Rajesh's visualisation first, followed by my improved version. Then, I will share my thoughts about his version and how I improved on it. Finally, I will go into the technical details about how I implemented my version and the additional insights that can be gained from it.\n\n## [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.1 Singapore's Population Pyramid\n\n::::: panel-tabset\n## Rajesh's\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npyramid_data <- raj_data %>%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  mutate(Pop = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", -Pop, Pop))\n\nggplot(pyramid_data, aes(x = Age, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs) +\n  labs(title = \"Singapore Population Pyramid (2024)\",\n       x = \"Age\", y = \"Population\",\n       fill = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## My Improvements\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Feature Engineering\nmakeover_data$Age <- as.character(makeover_data$Age)\n\nmakeover_data$Age[makeover_data$Age == \"90_and_Over\"] <- \"90\"\n\nmakeover_data$Age <- as.numeric(makeover_data$Age)\n\npyramid_data <- makeover_data %>%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  mutate(inv_Pop = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", -Pop, Pop))\n\nr1 <- ggplot(pyramid_data, aes(x = Age, y = inv_Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_area(stat = \"identity\", colour = \"grey30\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = c(-40000, 40000)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10), position = \"top\") +\n  labs(title = \"Singapore's Population Pyramid (2024)\",\n       x = NULL, y = \"Population\",\n       fill = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.margin = margin(0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.2, \"cm\")\n  ) +  \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Sex\",\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#56BCC2\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#E87D72\"),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  )\n\nr2 <- ggplot(pyramid_data, aes(x = Age, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_area(stat = \"identity\", position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5, width = 1, colour = \"grey30\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = c(0, 40000)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Population\",\n       fill = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.margin = margin(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0, \"cm\")\n  )\n\nr1 + r2 +\n  plot_layout(widths = c(3, 1))\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Good Design Choices\n\n1)  The horizontal bar chart of **Population** across **Age**, with **Males** on the left and **Females** on the right, clearly demonstrates his design intent of creating a population pyramid segmented by **Sex**.\n2)  The use of colours effectively distinguishes the **Genders**, with **Males** in blue and **Females** in red.\n3)  The inclusion of a clear title and legend reinforces the design intent by specifying that the chart represents Singapore's Population Pyramid for the year 2024 and confirms the **Gender** colour association.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Poor Design Choices and My Improvements\n\n1.  The y-axis is overly clustered with numbers overlapping, making it difficult to read.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: For the Age column, the string label 90_and_Over was converted to an integer value of 90, and formatted the y-axis to display in increments of 10.\n2.  Some sections of the bar chart display a white divider between bars, while others do not, resulting in an inconsistent and a messy appearance. It is also difficult to compare **Gender** populations at specific **Ages**.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: An area chart with black outlines was used instead of a bar chart for a cleaner visual. Additionally, a comparative overlay chart was placed to the right of the plot to facilitate easy comparisons between **Male** and **Female** populations.\n3.  The **Male** and **Female** charts uses different x-axis scales, which misleadingly suggests similar population sizes. Additionally, the legend order (**Females** → **Males**) does not match the chart order (**Males** → **Females**).\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Standardised the x-axis for both **Genders** to 0-40,000. The legend was also reordered to reflect the chart layout (**Males** → **Females**).\n:::\n\n### [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.1.1 Techical Explanation\n\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh's \"*Singapore’s Population Pyramid*\" visualisation. \n\n- The **Age** column was converted to string format before replacing *90_and_Over* with *90*. Then, the column was converted to a numerical formal. \n- The bar graph was changed to an area graph using *geom_area()* instead of *geom_bar()*. \n- The x-axis scale was fixed by using *scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = c(-40000, 40000))* to set the range to be from -40,000 to 40,000.\n- *scale_y_continuous()* was used because after *coord_flip()*, it adjusts the x-axis instead. \n- The legend position was switch to the bottom using *theme()* and the legend order was fixed using *scale_fill_manual()*. \n- Finally, the overlaid gender chart was created using the same *geom_area()* method but using *y = Pop* instead of *y = inv_Pop*.\n\n### [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.1.1 Summary\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Improvements\n\n-   The improved graph is cleaner.\n-   The **Male** and **Female** graphs are scaled according to their respective population sizes.\n-   The population difference between **Males** and **Females** can be viewed easily through the graph on the right.\n:::\n\n## [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.2 Most Populous Planning Areas\n\n::::: panel-tabset\n## Rajesh's\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_pa <- raj_data %>%\n  group_by(PA) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Pop)) %>%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nggplot(top_pa, aes(x = reorder(PA, Total_Pop), y = Total_Pop)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Populous Planning Areas (2024)\",\n       x = \"Planning Area\", y = \"Total Population\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## My Improvements\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregion_mapping <- tibble::tibble(\n  PA = c(\n    #

The x-axis uses scientific notation, which is not reader-friendly.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Changed the x-axis formatting to use standard numerical values with comma-separators for thousands.\n2.  The graph is overly simplistic and lacks depth, missing an opportunity to provide broader insights into Singapore's Demographic distribution.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Added a secondary **Region** field to segment the **Planning Areas**.\n3.  The graph excludes data on the remaining **Planning Areas** in Singapore.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Expanded the chart to include all populated **Planning Areas**, and introduced a zoomed-in section for the 10 least populous **Planning Areas** for better clarity on their regional classification.\n:::\n\n### [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.2.1 Techical Explanation\n\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh's \"*Most Populous Planning Areas*\" visualisation. \n\n- I had already implemented segregating **Planning Areas** by **Sex** in [Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Population Across Planning Areas by Sex](https://isss608-ay2024-25t3.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01-1/take-home_ex01-1#plots-and-analysis). Therefore, while looking through my classmates' submissions, I was inspired to use the approach by [DO QUYNH TRANG](https://isss608-ay2425-qtd.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01#singapores-population-distribution-and-density) in implementing **Regions**. \n- The data was then grouped by **PA** and **Region**. \n- *scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)* was used to convert the x-axis formatting from standard numerical values to comma-separators for thousands. \n- The rest of the implementation is similar to my approach in [Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Population Across Planning Areas by Sex](https://isss608-ay2024-25t3.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01-1/take-home_ex01-1#methods-and-explanation).\n\n### [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.2.1 Summary\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Improvements\n\n-   The improved graph provides information on all the **Planning Areas** instead of just the top 10 most populous ones. \n_ The improved graph is segregated by **Regions** and provides additional insights.\n    -   For example, the **Planning Areas** in the bottom half of the plot are predominately composed of those in the **Central** region.\n:::\n\n## [1-2:]{style=\"color:DarkOrange\"} 2.3 Gender Ratio by Planning Areas\n\n::::: panel-tabset\n## Rajesh's\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngender_ratio <- raj_data %>%\n  group_by(PA, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = Pop) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Males) & !is.na(Females) & Females > 0) %>%  \n  mutate(Gender_Ratio = Males / Females)\n\nggplot(gender_ratio, aes(x = reorder(PA, Gender_Ratio), y = Gender_Ratio)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"purple\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Gender Ratio (Males/Females) by Planning Area (2024)\",\n       x = \"Planning Area\", y = \"Gender Ratio\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## My Improvements\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngender_ratio <- makeover_data %>%\n  group_by(PA, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  group_by(PA) %>%\n  mutate(\n    TotalInGroup = sum(Total_Pop),\n    Proportion = Total_Pop / TotalInGroup * 100) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Proportion))\n\ngender_ratio_males <- gender_ratio %>%\n  filter(Sex == \"Males\")\n\ngender_ratio_order <- gender_ratio_males %>%\n  arrange(Proportion) %>%\n  pull(PA)\n\ngender_ratio <- gender_ratio %>%\n  mutate(\n    PA = factor(PA, levels = gender_ratio_order)\n    )\n\nggplot(gender_ratio, aes(x = Proportion, y = PA, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color = \"purple\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Gender Ratio (Males/Females) by Planning Area (2024)\",\n    x = \"Percentage\",\n    y = \"Planning Area\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  ) +  \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Sex\",\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#56BCC2\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#E87D72\"),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Good Design Choices\n\n1)  The graph is appropriately ordered, making it easy to identify which **Planning Areas** have higher **Gender Ratios**.\n2)  The title is concise and descriptive.\n3)  The axis are correctly labelled with **Planning Area** and **Gender Ratio** to clarify the data shown.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Bad Design Choices and My Improvements\n\n1.  The graph is difficult to understand since the concept of **Gender Ratio** is not intuitive.

The y-axis, listing the **Planning Areas**, is crowded and lacks visual separation.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Increased the plot height using *#\\| fig-height: 6* to improve readability and add space between the **Planning Area** labels.\n3.  The x-axis range (0 to \\~1.1) does not represent the full spectrum of **Gender Ratio**, which should ideally be 0 to 2, with 1 as the median. This median is also missing from the graph.\n    -   [Improvements]{.underline}: Redefined the x-axis to span 0-100, and included a vertical line at 50 to denote the midpoint.

This website was created as part of the coursework for ISSS608: Visual Analytics and Applications, a module under the Master of IT in Business (MITB) program at Singapore Management University (SMU). It was developed using RStudio with Quarto, version-controlled via GitHub, and published through Netlify.

The author, Calvin Tan Song Hao, is an aspiring Data Analyst and a current student in the SMU MITB program. With a background in R&D engineering, I aim to leverage my analytical skills and technical expertise to solve real-world problems and uncover data-driven insights that support impactful decision-making.

    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore using ggplot2, it is important to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n Reference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28. \nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

The ggplot2 extension extension called patchwork  is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax for creating layouts super easily. The general syntax is:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus sign “+”\nParenthesis “()” to create a subplot group\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division design “/”\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combing Two ggplot2 Graphs\nThe figure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork.

For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other\n“()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting\n\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a Composite Figure with Tagging\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake note that the tagging goes from top left -&gt; btm left -&gt; top right -&gt; btm right!\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating Figure with Insertion\nPatchwork allows more than just providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout.

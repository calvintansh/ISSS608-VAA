These were the steps taken to create a stacked horizontal bar chart for visualisation:\nHorizontal Bar Chart s1:\n\nTo create a horizontal bar chart with population Total in descending order, the PA was initially ordered by ascending Total using the pa_order() vector. Although the factor levels were arranged in ascending order, the use of coord_flip() in the plot reverses the axis orientation, resulting in Total being displayed in descending order as intended.\nggplot() was used with geom_bar() (with stat = “identity” and position = “stack”) to create a stacked horizontal bar chart (s1), displaying the Pop by Sex across PA.\ntheme_minimal() was applied for a clean visual style, and labs() with ggtitle() were used to customise the axis labels and plot title.\nscale_fill_manual() was used to assign distinct colours to Males and Females and to control the legend order, explicitly setting it as: Males → Females instead of the reversed order if left as default.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) was used to show numerical numbers rather than the scientific notation.\ntheme(legend.position = “bottom”) was used to move the legend position from the right to the bottom to allow the plot to be wider.\n\nZoomed-in Plot s2:\n\nA zoomed-in plot (s2) shows the bottom 10 PA and will be embedded into the main plot later. This method makes it easier to examine less populous PAs in the same figure.\nSince the zoomed-in plot (s2) will be overlaid on top of the main chart (s1), theme_test() was used to provide a contrast with the main s1 plot in the background.\nThe legend and background was removed using theme() and the axis titles were removed using labs() for a cleaner plot.\n\nZoom Rectangle:\n\nThis was created using cowplot() to be a transparent dotted line rectangle to allow highlighting of the zoomed-in location.\n\nOverlaid Plots:\n\nggdraw() was used to create an empty canvas, and draw_plot() was used to overlay s1, s2, and the zoom rectangles. All these functions are a part of the cowplot package.\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.1.3 Plots and Analysis\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npa_order &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  distinct(PA, Total) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Total) %&gt;%\n  pull(PA)\n\ndemography_sex &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PA = factor(PA, levels = pa_order)\n  )\n\ns1 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Planing Area\",\n    y = \"Population\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Population Across Planning Areas by Sex\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\ndemography_sex_bottom10 &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  filter(PA %in% head(pa_order, 10))\n\ns2 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex_bottom10, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_test() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA)\n  )\n\nzoom_rect &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 1, ymin = 0, ymax = 1),\n            fill = NA, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_void()\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(s1, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(s2, 0.4, 0.185, 0.56, 0.25) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.005, 0.155, 0.3, 0.206) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.37, 0.18, 0.62, 0.27) # (left , btm, right, top)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Populated\n\nTampines\nBedok\nSengkang\nJurong West\nWoodlands\n\n\n\n\nLeast Populated\n\nSeletar\nMuseum\nWestern Water Catchment\nSungei Kadut\nOrchard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nGender Ratio\n\nThe Sex distribution is generally balanced across all PAs.\n\n\n\nResidential Areas\n\nThe most populated PAs consists of a mix of mature estates (e.g., Tampines, Bedok) and newer estates (e.g, Sengkang, Jurong West, Woodlands) (Refer to Section 5 Appendix: Singapore’s Estate Classification\nThis reflects the government of Singapore’s success in transforming newer towns or underutilised land into well-developed residential hubs that are comparable to existing mature estates.\n\n\n\nCommercial / Industrial /Military Areas\n\nThe least populated PAs are primarily non-residential zones such as:\n\nCommercial: Museum, Orchard\nIndustrial: Sungei Kadut\nMilitary/Nature: Seletar (air base), Western Water Catchment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.2.4 Reflections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nThe ggforce package includes the facet_zoom() function that allows for zooming in on a part of a plot and automatically draws a box to indicate the zoomed region.\nHowever, facet_zoom() does not support zooming in on discrete scales like the bottom 10 PAs in Pop.

    "text": "1-1: 3.3 Age Distribution by Sex\nSingapore, like many developed countries, is facing the issue of declining birth rates and an increasingly Aging Population. This visualization aims to provide insight into Singapore’s Population pyramid and Gender distribution.\n\n1-1: 3.3.1 Feature Engineering\nThe first part of the code aggregates the Population by Sex, and calculates the percentage of Males and Females by dividing it by the Total.\n\nThe next section prepares for adding labels to the pie chart. The label position (ypos) was calculated using cumulative percentages cumsum(Pct_Sex) - Pct_Sex / 2 since coord_polar(“y”) will be used to create the pie chart.\n\nThe next part of the code is for calculating the gender ratio. Violin plots are normalised to 1 by default so this ratio is needed to adjust the Male plot to be slightly smaller than the Female plot.\nIn the third part, the dataset was prepared to visualise Age distributions by Sex:\n\nThe dataset sg_data was grouped by Age and Sex, then summarised using sum(Pop) to get the population count for each Age-Sex group.\nThe resulting grouped data demography_sex_age was expanded into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop).\n\nThis transformation duplicates each row according to the Pop count, effectively simulating individual records. This is a requirement for plotting accurate violin plots of distributions.\n\n\nThe code below performs the steps above and finally splits the demography_sex_age data into two subsets (Males and Females) to allow overlaying their respective violin plots for easier visual comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# First Part\ntotal_by_sex &lt;- aggregate(Pop ~ Sex, data = sg_data, sum) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Total = sum(Pop))\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Pct_Sex = (Pop / Total) * 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Sex, Pct_Sex)\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- pct_total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Sex)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ypos = cumsum(Pct_Sex) -

30)\n\nMales consistently outnumber Females slightly till age 30.\nPopulation rises gradual from birth to age 8.\nA plateau is observed from ages 9 to 20, followed by another increase towards 30.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age 30 - 60)\n\nThe segment holds the largest proportion of Singapore’s population.\nFemales outnumber Males except for a brief period between age 57-65.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age Above 60)\n\nA steady decline beings from age 60 onward.\nThe Male population decreases at a faster rate, leading to a widening gender gap with increasing age.\n\n\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nThe age distribution resembles that of an ageing population which is consistent with other developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.3.4 Reflections and Initial Workings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nI initially avoided expanding the data into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop), since it is possible to pass weights = Pop in aes(). However, the resulting violin plot (below) looked weird. Therefore, I tried the uncount() method and found that these 2 methods produces very different plots. Upon further research, I found that while geom_violin() can estimate the probability density function (PDF) using the weights, density estimation with weights may be less precise or behave unexpectedly depending on implementation. Therefore, I chose to use uncount() in the final plot above, as working with raw, individual-level distributions seems to produce more accurate and visually realistic results.\n\n\nFeature Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemography_sex_age_2 &lt;- sg_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop))\n\ndemography_sex_age_2\n\n# A tibble: 182 × 3\n# Groups:   Age [91]\n     Age Sex       Pop\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     0 Females 14370\n 2     0 Males   15090\n 3     1 Females 15580\n 4     1 Males   16700\n 5     2 Females 17190\n 6     2 Males   17980\n 7     3 Females 17340\n 8     3 Males   18200\n 9     4 Females 19070\n10     4 Males   19880\n# ℹ 172 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots and Reflections\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=demography_sex_age_2, \n       aes(y = Age, \n           x= Sex,\n           weight = Pop,\n           fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"area\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sex\",\n    y = \"Age\",\n    title = \"Age Distribution by Sex\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\")\n    )",

At the same time, data (i) reshaped by using tidyr package, and (ii) processed, wrangled and transformed with dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot to convey motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it is important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it make sense to go through the effort of making animated graphs?\n\n\n\nBefore making animated graphs, think of the above question first.\n\nAn animated graphic may not be worth the time investment for just exploratory data analysis.\nHowever, in a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.",

Each frame is a different plot to convey motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.",

    "text": "Before diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it is important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it make sense to go through the effort of making animated graphs?\n\n\n\nBefore making animated graphs, think of the above question first.\n\nAn animated graphic may not be worth the time investment for just exploratory data analysis.\nHowever, in a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.",

The ggplot2 extension extension called patchwork  is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax for creating layouts super easily. The general syntax is:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus sign “+”\nParenthesis “()” to create a subplot group\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division design “/”",

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat is because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.",

It is also difficult to compare Gender populations at specific Ages.\n\nImprovements: An area chart with black outlines was used instead of a bar chart for a cleaner visual. Additionally, a comparative overlay chart was placed to the right of the plot to facilitate easy comparisons between Male and Female populations.\n\nThe Male and Female charts uses different x-axis scales, which misleadingly suggests similar population sizes. Additionally, the legend order (Females → Males) does not match the chart order (Males → Females).\n\nImprovements: Standardised the x-axis for both Genders to 0-40,000. The legend was also reordered to reflect the chart layout (Males → Females).\n\n\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.1.1 Techical Explanation\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh’s “Singapore’s Population Pyramid” visualisation.\n\nThe Age column was converted to string format before replacing 90_and_Over with 90. Then, the column was converted to a numerical formal.\nThe bar graph was changed to an area graph using geom_area() instead of geom_bar().\nThe x-axis scale was fixed by using scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = c(-40000, 40000)) to set the range to be from -40,000 to 40,000.\nscale_y_continuous() was used because after coord_flip(), it adjusts the x-axis instead.\nThe legend position was switch to the bottom using theme() and the legend order was fixed using scale_fill_manual().\nFinally, the overlaid gender chart was created using the same geom_area() method but using y = Pop instead of y = inv_Pop.\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.1.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph is cleaner.\nThe Male and Female graphs are scaled according to their respective population sizes.\nThe population difference between Males and Females can be viewed easily through the graph on the right.",

Therefore, while looking through my classmates’ submissions, I was inspired to use the approach by DO QUYNH TRANG in implementing Regions.\nThe data was then grouped by PA and Region.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) was used to convert the x-axis formatting from standard numerical values to comma-separators for thousands.\nThe rest of the implementation is similar to my approach in Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Population Across Planning Areas by Sex.\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.2.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph provides information on all the Planning Areas instead of just the top 10 most populous ones. _ The improved graph is segregated by Regions and provides additional insights.\n\nFor example, the Planning Areas in the bottom half of the plot are predominately composed of those in the Central region.",

A value of 1 signifies equal numbers of Males and Females, while values above 1 indicates more Males.\n\nImprovements: Replaced the Gender Ratio with a Gender percentage distribution. The length of the Male/Female bar can then reflect their relative share within each Planning Area.\n\nThe y-axis, listing the Planning Areas, is crowded and lacks visual separation.\n\nImprovements: Increased the plot height using #| fig-height: 6 to improve readability and add space between the Planning Area labels.\n\nThe x-axis range (0 to ~1.1) does not represent the full spectrum of Gender Ratio, which should ideally be 0 to 2, with 1 as the median. This median is also missing from the graph.\n\nImprovements: Redefined the x-axis to span 0-100, and included a vertical line at 50 to denote the midpoint. Any bar exceeding this line indicates a Male-dominant area while those that do not reflect a Female-dominant one.\n\n\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.3.1 Techical Explanation\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh’s “Gender Ratio by Planning Areas” visualisation.\n\nThe height of the plot was lengthened using #| fig-height: 6.\nThe data preparation step is similar to my approach in Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Percentage of Age Groups by Planning Areas, but instead of calculating the percentage of Age Groups for each Planning Area, I calculated the percentage of Sex for each Planning Area.\nA median line at 50% was added using geom_vline().\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.3.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph is more visually appealing.\nIt is more intuitive and explains the population distributions between Males and Females better.\nThe new graph clearly shows that only two Planning Areas, Sungei Kadut and Changi, have a higher Male population compared to Females.",

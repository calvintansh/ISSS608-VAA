The ggplot2 extension extension called patchwork  is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax for creating layouts super easily. The general syntax is:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus sign “+”\nParenthesis “()” to create a subplot group\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division design “/”\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combing Two ggplot2 Graphs\nThe figure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork.

For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other\n“()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting\n\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a Composite Figure with Tagging\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake note that the tagging goes from top left -&gt; btm left -&gt; top right -&gt; btm right!\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating Figure with Insertion\nPatchwork allows more than just providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element(), one or several plots or graphic elements can be placed freely on top or below another plot.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2,\n                   left = 0.02,\n                   bottom = 0.7,\n                   right = 0.5,\n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a Composite Figure by Using patchwork and ggtheme\nThe figure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3 \npatchwork & theme_economist()",

    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore using ggplot2, it is important to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.",

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n3.7.1 Creating an Interactive Scatter Plot: plot_ly() Method\nThe tabset below shows an example of a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(\n  data=exam_data,\n  x = ~MATHS,\n  y = ~ENGLISH\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nThe code using plot_ly() is simpler than ggplot2.\nplot_ly() is interactive by default as compared to ggplot2 Hands-On Exercise 3: Section 3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data=exam_data,\n        x = ~ENGLISH,\n        y = ~MATHS,\n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInteractive: Click on the colour symbol at the legend.\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only extra line needed in the code chunk is ggplotly().\nThis is much simpler as compared to the ggplot2 tooltip method in Hands-On Exercise 3: Section 3.5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Coordinated multiple views with plotly\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\nTwo scatter plots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nLastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\nThis code is much simpler than the ggiraph method in Hands-On Exercise 3: Section 3.6.7\n\nAnother difference is that the plotly highlight_key() method shows it’s corresponding point on click but the ggiraph method shows it’s corresponding point on hover.\n\nClicking on any data point results in a permanent selection, with no way to deselect.\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nLearn more about crosswalk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nBut is it possible to make it on hover instead?\n\nBy default, highlight_key() works on click, not hover but using plotly_hover allows it to mirror the ggiraph method in Hands-On Exercise 3: Section 3.6.7\n\nAnd how about fixing the annoying permanent selection issue?\n\nAdding selectize = FALSE allows for the user to do a double-click on any blank space to reset selection and shows all points again\n\nLastly, where are the axis labels?\n\nUse labs(), titleX and titleY to add axis labels\nUse margin so that the labels will not overlap the graph\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100), ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  labs(x = \"Maths\", y = \"English\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS, y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100), ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  labs(x = \"Maths\", y = \"Science\")\n\nsubplot(\n  ggplotly(p1),\n  ggplotly(p2),\n  titleX = TRUE,\n  titleY = TRUE,\n  margin = 0.05) %&gt;%\n  highlight(on = \"plotly_hover\", selectize = FALSE)",

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.",

    "text": "This exercise will target to answer one of the three challenges from VAST 2025 which features a fictitious island nation, Oceanus, famous for fishing and quiet seaside communities.\nThe chosen challenge is Mini-Challenge 1.\n\n\nOne of music’s biggest superstars is Oceanus native Sailor Shift. From humble beginnings, Sailor has grown in popularity and now enjoys fans around the world. Sailor started her career on the island nation of Oceanus which can be clearly seen in her early work, she started in the genre of “Oceanus Folk”. While Sailor has moved away from the traditional Oceanus style, the Oceanus Folk has made a name for itself in the musical world. The popularity of this music is one of the factors driving an increase in tourism to a quiet island nation that used to be known for fishing.\nIn 2023, Sailor Shift joined the Ivy Echoes – an all-female Oceanus Folk band consisting of Sailor (vocalist), Maya Jensen (vocalist), Lila “Lilly” Hartman (guitarist), Jade Thompson (drummer), and Sophie Ramirez (bassist). They played together at venues throughout Oceanus but had broken up to pursue their individual careers by 2026. Sailor’s breakthrough came in 2028 when one of her singles went viral, launched to the top of the global charts (something no other Oceanus Folk song had ever done). Since then, she has only continued to grow in popularity worldwide.\nSailor has released a new album almost every year since her big break, and each has done better than the last. Although she has remained primarily a solo artist, she has also frequently collaborated with other established artists, especially in the Indie Pop and Indie Folk genres. She herself has branched out musically over the years but regularly returns to the Oceanus Folk genre — even as the genre’s influence on the rest of the music world has spread even more.\nSailor has always been passionate about two things: (1) spreading Oceanus Folk, and (2) helping lesser-known artists break into music. Because of those goals, she’s particularly famous for her frequent collaborations.\nAdditionally, because of Sailor’s success, more attention began to be paid over the years to her previous bandmates. All 4 have continued in the music industry—Maya as an independent vocalist, Lilly and Jade as instrumentalists in other bands, and Sophie as a music producer for a major record label. In various ways, all of them have contributed to the increased influence of Oceanus folk, resulting in a new generation of up-and-coming Oceanus Folk artists seeking to make a name for themselves in the music industry.\nNow, as Sailor returns to Oceanus in 2040, a local journalist – Silas Reed – is writing a piece titled Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now that aims to trace the rise of Sailor and the influence of Oceanus Folk on the rest of the music world. He has collected a large dataset of musical artists, producers, albums, songs, and influences and organized it into a knowledge graph. Your task is to help Silas create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information about Sailor’s past, her rise to stardom, and her influence.\n\n\n\n\nDesign and develop visualizations and visual analytic tools that will allow Silas to explore and understand the profile of Sailor Shift’s career\n\nWho has she been most influenced by over time?\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\nHow has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\n\nDevelop visualizations that illustrate how the influence of Oceanus Folk has spread through the musical world.\n\nWas this influence intermittent or did it have a gradual rise?\nWhat genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\nOn the converse, how has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\nUse your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.\n\nVisualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.\nUsing this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this exercise is from VAST 2025 MC1.\n\n\n\nGraph Description - Directed Multigraph - # nodes: 17,412 - # edges: 37, 857 - 18 connected components - Possible node types are: {Person, Song, RecordLabel, Album, MusicalGroup} - Possible edge types are: {MemberOf, PerformerOf, ComposerOf, ProducerOf, LyricistOf, InStyleOf, InterpolatesFrom, CoverOf, LyricalReferenceTo, DirectlySamples, RecordedBy, DistributedBy} - The graph format is a JSON file. The root-level JSON object consists of graph-level properties specifying that it is directed and a multigraph, a “nodes” key which holds the list of nodes, and a “links” key which holds the list of edges.\nThe data for this challenge comes from two different sources:\n\nan online, crowdsourced repository of musical influence, where contributors have manually notated instances in which songs or albums have sampled, covered, or otherwise drawn inspiration from previous work.\naggregate-level descriptions of song popularity, as labeled by our journalist, Silas Reed. These notations (notable and notoriety_date) are directly based on both the number of sales and streams that the song/album has achieved as well as the whether or not the work landed on a top record chart.\n\n\n\n\nUtility Tools\n\njsonlite: To parse JSON\ntidyverse - Data science tools\nggtext - Tools for text formatting\nknitr - For better table displays\nlubridate - For processing date and time\n\nGraphing Tools\n\npatchwork - For combining ggplot plots\nggraph - For plotting network data\ntidygraph - For graph manipulations\nigraph - Contains functions for network analysis\nggiraph - Interactive plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(jsonlite, tidyverse, ggtext,\n                knitr, lubridate, patchwork,\n                ggraph, tidygraph, igraph,\n                ggiraph)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called MC1_graph will be used.

It is also difficult to compare Gender populations at specific Ages.\n\nImprovements: An area chart with black outlines was used instead of a bar chart for a cleaner visual. Additionally, a comparative overlay chart was placed to the right of the plot to facilitate easy comparisons between Male and Female populations.\n\nThe Male and Female charts uses different x-axis scales, which misleadingly suggests similar population sizes. Additionally, the legend order (Females → Males) does not match the chart order (Males → Females).\n\nImprovements: Standardised the x-axis for both Genders to 0-40,000. The legend was also reordered to reflect the chart layout (Males → Females).\n\n\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.1.1 Techical Explanation\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh’s “Singapore’s Population Pyramid” visualisation.\n\nThe Age column was converted to string format before replacing 90_and_Over with 90. Then, the column was converted to a numerical formal.\nThe bar graph was changed to an area graph using geom_area() instead of geom_bar().\nThe x-axis scale was fixed by using scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = c(-40000, 40000)) to set the range to be from -40,000 to 40,000.\nscale_y_continuous() was used because after coord_flip(), it adjusts the x-axis instead.\nThe legend position was switch to the bottom using theme() and the legend order was fixed using scale_fill_manual().\nFinally, the overlaid gender chart was created using the same geom_area() method but using y = Pop instead of y = inv_Pop.\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.1.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph is cleaner.\nThe Male and Female graphs are scaled according to their respective population sizes.\nThe population difference between Males and Females can be viewed easily through the graph on the right.",

Therefore, while looking through my classmates’ submissions, I was inspired to use the approach by DO QUYNH TRANG in implementing Regions.\nThe data was then grouped by PA and Region.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) was used to convert the x-axis formatting from standard numerical values to comma-separators for thousands.\nThe rest of the implementation is similar to my approach in Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Population Across Planning Areas by Sex.\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.2.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph provides information on all the Planning Areas instead of just the top 10 most populous ones. _ The improved graph is segregated by Regions and provides additional insights.\n\nFor example, the Planning Areas in the bottom half of the plot are predominately composed of those in the Central region.",

A value of 1 signifies equal numbers of Males and Females, while values above 1 indicates more Males.\n\nImprovements: Replaced the Gender Ratio with a Gender percentage distribution. The length of the Male/Female bar can then reflect their relative share within each Planning Area.\n\nThe y-axis, listing the Planning Areas, is crowded and lacks visual separation.\n\nImprovements: Increased the plot height using #| fig-height: 6 to improve readability and add space between the Planning Area labels.\n\nThe x-axis range (0 to ~1.1) does not represent the full spectrum of Gender Ratio, which should ideally be 0 to 2, with 1 as the median. This median is also missing from the graph.\n\nImprovements: Redefined the x-axis to span 0-100, and included a vertical line at 50 to denote the midpoint. Any bar exceeding this line indicates a Male-dominant area while those that do not reflect a Female-dominant one.\n\n\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.3.1 Techical Explanation\nThis section will cover the code and techniques used to improve on Rajesh’s “Gender Ratio by Planning Areas” visualisation.\n\nThe height of the plot was lengthened using #| fig-height: 6.\nThe data preparation step is similar to my approach in Take-Home Exercise 1-1: Percentage of Age Groups by Planning Areas, but instead of calculating the percentage of Age Groups for each Planning Area, I calculated the percentage of Sex for each Planning Area.\nA median line at 50% was added using geom_vline().\n\n\n\n1-2: 2.3.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\n\nThe improved graph is more visually appealing.\nIt is more intuitive and explains the population distributions between Males and Females better.\nThe new graph clearly shows that only two Planning Areas, Sungei Kadut and Changi, have a higher Male population compared to Females.",

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat is because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.",

    "text": "This exercise will target to answer one of the three challenges from VAST 2025 which features a fictitious island nation, Oceanus, famous for fishing and quiet seaside communities.\nThe chosen challenge is Mini-Challenge 1.\n\n\nOne of music’s biggest superstars is Oceanus native Sailor Shift. From humble beginnings, Sailor has grown in popularity and now enjoys fans around the world. Sailor started her career on the island nation of Oceanus which can be clearly seen in her early work, she started in the genre of “Oceanus Folk”. While Sailor has moved away from the traditional Oceanus style, the Oceanus Folk has made a name for itself in the musical world. The popularity of this music is one of the factors driving an increase in tourism to a quiet island nation that used to be known for fishing.\nIn 2023, Sailor Shift joined the Ivy Echoes – an all-female Oceanus Folk band consisting of Sailor (vocalist), Maya Jensen (vocalist), Lila “Lilly” Hartman (guitarist), Jade Thompson (drummer), and Sophie Ramirez (bassist). They played together at venues throughout Oceanus but had broken up to pursue their individual careers by 2026. Sailor’s breakthrough came in 2028 when one of her singles went viral, launched to the top of the global charts (something no other Oceanus Folk song had ever done). Since then, she has only continued to grow in popularity worldwide.\nSailor has released a new album almost every year since her big break, and each has done better than the last. Although she has remained primarily a solo artist, she has also frequently collaborated with other established artists, especially in the Indie Pop and Indie Folk genres. She herself has branched out musically over the years but regularly returns to the Oceanus Folk genre — even as the genre’s influence on the rest of the music world has spread even more.\nSailor has always been passionate about two things: (1) spreading Oceanus Folk, and (2) helping lesser-known artists break into music. Because of those goals, she’s particularly famous for her frequent collaborations.\nAdditionally, because of Sailor’s success, more attention began to be paid over the years to her previous bandmates. All 4 have continued in the music industry—Maya as an independent vocalist, Lilly and Jade as instrumentalists in other bands, and Sophie as a music producer for a major record label. In various ways, all of them have contributed to the increased influence of Oceanus folk, resulting in a new generation of up-and-coming Oceanus Folk artists seeking to make a name for themselves in the music industry.\nNow, as Sailor returns to Oceanus in 2040, a local journalist – Silas Reed – is writing a piece titled Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now that aims to trace the rise of Sailor and the influence of Oceanus Folk on the rest of the music world. He has collected a large dataset of musical artists, producers, albums, songs, and influences and organized it into a knowledge graph. Your task is to help Silas create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information about Sailor’s past, her rise to stardom, and her influence.\n\n\n\n\nDesign and develop visualizations and visual analytic tools that will allow Silas to explore and understand the profile of Sailor Shift’s career\n\nWho has she been most influenced by over time?\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\nHow has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\n\nDevelop visualizations that illustrate how the influence of Oceanus Folk has spread through the musical world.\n\nWas this influence intermittent or did it have a gradual rise?\nWhat genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\nOn the converse, how has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\nUse your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.\n\nVisualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.\nUsing this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this exercise is from VAST 2025 MC1.\n\n\n\nGraph Description - Directed Multigraph - # nodes: 17,412 - # edges: 37, 857 - 18 connected components - Possible node types are: {Person, Song, RecordLabel, Album, MusicalGroup} - Possible edge types are: {MemberOf, PerformerOf, ComposerOf, ProducerOf, LyricistOf, InStyleOf, InterpolatesFrom, CoverOf, LyricalReferenceTo, DirectlySamples, RecordedBy, DistributedBy} - The graph format is a JSON file. The root-level JSON object consists of graph-level properties specifying that it is directed and a multigraph, a “nodes” key which holds the list of nodes, and a “links” key which holds the list of edges.\nThe data for this challenge comes from two different sources:\n\nan online, crowdsourced repository of musical influence, where contributors have manually notated instances in which songs or albums have sampled, covered, or otherwise drawn inspiration from previous work.\naggregate-level descriptions of song popularity, as labeled by our journalist, Silas Reed. These notations (notable and notoriety_date) are directly based on both the number of sales and streams that the song/album has achieved as well as the whether or not the work landed on a top record chart.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below, p_load() of pacman package is used to load the R packages into R environmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, jsonlite,\n                SmartEDA, tidygraph,\n                ggraph)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called MC1_graph will be used.

These were the steps taken to create a stacked horizontal bar chart for visualisation:\nHorizontal Bar Chart s1:\n\nTo create a horizontal bar chart with population Total in descending order, the PA was initially ordered by ascending Total using the pa_order() vector. Although the factor levels were arranged in ascending order, the use of coord_flip() in the plot reverses the axis orientation, resulting in Total being displayed in descending order as intended.\nggplot() was used with geom_bar() (with stat = “identity” and position = “stack”) to create a stacked horizontal bar chart (s1), displaying the Pop by Sex across PA.\ntheme_minimal() was applied for a clean visual style, and labs() with ggtitle() were used to customise the axis labels and plot title.\nscale_fill_manual() was used to assign distinct colours to Males and Females and to control the legend order, explicitly setting it as: Males → Females instead of the reversed order if left as default.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) was used to show numerical numbers rather than the scientific notation.\ntheme(legend.position = “bottom”) was used to move the legend position from the right to the bottom to allow the plot to be wider.\n\nZoomed-in Plot s2:\n\nA zoomed-in plot (s2) shows the bottom 10 PA and will be embedded into the main plot later. This method makes it easier to examine less populous PAs in the same figure.\nSince the zoomed-in plot (s2) will be overlaid on top of the main chart (s1), theme_test() was used to provide a contrast with the main s1 plot in the background.\nThe legend and background was removed using theme() and the axis titles were removed using labs() for a cleaner plot.\n\nZoom Rectangle:\n\nThis was created using cowplot() to be a transparent dotted line rectangle to allow highlighting of the zoomed-in location.\n\nOverlaid Plots:\n\nggdraw() was used to create an empty canvas, and draw_plot() was used to overlay s1, s2, and the zoom rectangles. All these functions are a part of the cowplot package.\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.1.3 Plots and Analysis\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npa_order &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  distinct(PA, Total) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Total) %&gt;%\n  pull(PA)\n\ndemography_sex &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PA = factor(PA, levels = pa_order)\n  )\n\ns1 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Planing Area\",\n    y = \"Population\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Population Across Planning Areas by Sex\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\ndemography_sex_bottom10 &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  filter(PA %in% head(pa_order, 10))\n\ns2 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex_bottom10, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_test() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA)\n  )\n\nzoom_rect &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 1, ymin = 0, ymax = 1),\n            fill = NA, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_void()\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(s1, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(s2, 0.4, 0.185, 0.56, 0.25) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.005, 0.155, 0.3, 0.206) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.37, 0.18, 0.62, 0.27) # (left , btm, right, top)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Populated\n\nTampines\nBedok\nSengkang\nJurong West\nWoodlands\n\n\n\n\nLeast Populated\n\nSeletar\nMuseum\nWestern Water Catchment\nSungei Kadut\nOrchard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nGender Ratio\n\nThe Sex distribution is generally balanced across all PAs.\n\n\n\nResidential Areas\n\nThe most populated PAs consists of a mix of mature estates (e.g., Tampines, Bedok) and newer estates (e.g, Sengkang, Jurong West, Woodlands) (Refer to Section 5 Appendix: Singapore’s Estate Classification\nThis reflects the government of Singapore’s success in transforming newer towns or underutilised land into well-developed residential hubs that are comparable to existing mature estates.\n\n\n\nCommercial / Industrial /Military Areas\n\nThe least populated PAs are primarily non-residential zones such as:\n\nCommercial: Museum, Orchard\nIndustrial: Sungei Kadut\nMilitary/Nature: Seletar (air base), Western Water Catchment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.2.4 Reflections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nThe ggforce package includes the facet_zoom() function that allows for zooming in on a part of a plot and automatically draws a box to indicate the zoomed region.\nHowever, facet_zoom() does not support zooming in on discrete scales like the bottom 10 PAs in Pop.

This visualization aims to provide insight into Singapore’s Population pyramid and Gender distribution.\n\n1-1: 3.3.1 Feature Engineering\nThe first part of the code aggregates the Population by Sex, and calculates the percentage of Males and Females by dividing it by the Total.\n\nThe next section prepares for adding labels to the pie chart. The label position (ypos) was calculated using cumulative percentages cumsum(Pct_Sex) - Pct_Sex / 2 since coord_polar(“y”) will be used to create the pie chart.\n\nThe next part of the code is for calculating the gender ratio. Violin plots are normalised to 1 by default so this ratio is needed to adjust the Male plot to be slightly smaller than the Female plot.\nIn the third part, the dataset was prepared to visualise Age distributions by Sex:\n\nThe dataset sg_data was grouped by Age and Sex, then summarised using sum(Pop) to get the population count for each Age-Sex group.\nThe resulting grouped data demography_sex_age was expanded into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop).\n\nThis transformation duplicates each row according to the Pop count, effectively simulating individual records. This is a requirement for plotting accurate violin plots of distributions.\n\n\nThe code below performs the steps above and finally splits the demography_sex_age data into two subsets (Males and Females) to allow overlaying their respective violin plots for easier visual comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# First Part\ntotal_by_sex &lt;- aggregate(Pop ~ Sex, data = sg_data, sum) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Total = sum(Pop))\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Pct_Sex = (Pop / Total) * 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Sex, Pct_Sex)\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- pct_total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Sex)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ypos = cumsum(Pct_Sex) -

30)\n\nMales consistently outnumber Females slightly till age 30.\nPopulation rises gradual from birth to age 8.\nA plateau is observed from ages 9 to 20, followed by another increase towards 30.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age 30 - 60)\n\nThe segment holds the largest proportion of Singapore’s population.\nFemales outnumber Males except for a brief period between age 57-65.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age Above 60)\n\nA steady decline beings from age 60 onward.\nThe Male population decreases at a faster rate, leading to a widening gender gap with increasing age.\n\n\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nThe age distribution resembles that of an ageing population which is consistent with other developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-1: 3.3.4 Reflections and Initial Workings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nI initially avoided expanding the data into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop), since it is possible to pass weights = Pop in aes(). However, the resulting violin plot (below) looked weird. Therefore, I tried the uncount() method and found that these 2 methods produces very different plots. Upon further research, I found that while geom_violin() can estimate the probability density function (PDF) using the weights, density estimation with weights may be less precise or behave unexpectedly depending on implementation. Therefore, I chose to use uncount() in the final plot above, as working with raw, individual-level distributions seems to produce more accurate and visually realistic results.\n\n\nFeature Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemography_sex_age_2 &lt;- sg_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop))\n\ndemography_sex_age_2\n\n# A tibble: 182 × 3\n# Groups:   Age [91]\n     Age Sex       Pop\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     0 Females 14370\n 2     0 Males   15090\n 3     1 Females 15580\n 4     1 Males   16700\n 5     2 Females 17190\n 6     2 Males   17980\n 7     3 Females 17340\n 8     3 Males   18200\n 9     4 Females 19070\n10     4 Males   19880\n# ℹ 172 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots and Reflections\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=demography_sex_age_2, \n       aes(y = Age, \n           x= Sex,\n           weight = Pop,\n           fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"area\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sex\",\n    y = \"Age\",\n    title = \"Age Distribution by Sex\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\")\n    )",

    "text": "This exercise will target to answer one of the three challenges from VAST 2025 which features a fictitious island nation, Oceanus, famous for fishing and quiet seaside communities.\nThe chosen challenge is Mini-Challenge 1.\n\n\nOne of music’s biggest superstars is Oceanus native Sailor Shift. From humble beginnings, Sailor has grown in popularity and now enjoys fans around the world. Sailor started her career on the island nation of Oceanus which can be clearly seen in her early work, she started in the genre of “Oceanus Folk”. While Sailor has moved away from the traditional Oceanus style, the Oceanus Folk has made a name for itself in the musical world. The popularity of this music is one of the factors driving an increase in tourism to a quiet island nation that used to be known for fishing.\nIn 2023, Sailor Shift joined the Ivy Echoes – an all-female Oceanus Folk band consisting of Sailor (vocalist), Maya Jensen (vocalist), Lila “Lilly” Hartman (guitarist), Jade Thompson (drummer), and Sophie Ramirez (bassist). They played together at venues throughout Oceanus but had broken up to pursue their individual careers by 2026. Sailor’s breakthrough came in 2028 when one of her singles went viral, launched to the top of the global charts (something no other Oceanus Folk song had ever done). Since then, she has only continued to grow in popularity worldwide.\nSailor has released a new album almost every year since her big break, and each has done better than the last. Although she has remained primarily a solo artist, she has also frequently collaborated with other established artists, especially in the Indie Pop and Indie Folk genres. She herself has branched out musically over the years but regularly returns to the Oceanus Folk genre — even as the genre’s influence on the rest of the music world has spread even more.\nSailor has always been passionate about two things: (1) spreading Oceanus Folk, and (2) helping lesser-known artists break into music. Because of those goals, she’s particularly famous for her frequent collaborations.\nAdditionally, because of Sailor’s success, more attention began to be paid over the years to her previous bandmates. All 4 have continued in the music industry—Maya as an independent vocalist, Lilly and Jade as instrumentalists in other bands, and Sophie as a music producer for a major record label. In various ways, all of them have contributed to the increased influence of Oceanus folk, resulting in a new generation of up-and-coming Oceanus Folk artists seeking to make a name for themselves in the music industry.\nNow, as Sailor returns to Oceanus in 2040, a local journalist – Silas Reed – is writing a piece titled Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now that aims to trace the rise of Sailor and the influence of Oceanus Folk on the rest of the music world. He has collected a large dataset of musical artists, producers, albums, songs, and influences and organized it into a knowledge graph. Your task is to help Silas create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information about Sailor’s past, her rise to stardom, and her influence.\n\n\n\n\nDesign and develop visualizations and visual analytic tools that will allow Silas to explore and understand the profile of Sailor Shift’s career\n\nWho has she been most influenced by over time?\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\nHow has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\n\nDevelop visualizations that illustrate how the influence of Oceanus Folk has spread through the musical world.\n\nWas this influence intermittent or did it have a gradual rise?\nWhat genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\nOn the converse, how has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\nUse your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.\n\nVisualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.\nUsing this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this exercise is from VAST 2025 MC1.\n\n\n\nGraph Description - Directed Multigraph - # nodes: 17,412 - # edges: 37, 857 - 18 connected components - Possible node types are: {Person, Song, RecordLabel, Album, MusicalGroup} - Possible edge types are: {MemberOf, PerformerOf, ComposerOf, ProducerOf, LyricistOf, InStyleOf, InterpolatesFrom, CoverOf, LyricalReferenceTo, DirectlySamples, RecordedBy, DistributedBy} - The graph format is a JSON file. The root-level JSON object consists of graph-level properties specifying that it is directed and a multigraph, a “nodes” key which holds the list of nodes, and a “links” key which holds the list of edges.\nThe data for this challenge comes from two different sources:\n\nan online, crowdsourced repository of musical influence, where contributors have manually notated instances in which songs or albums have sampled, covered, or otherwise drawn inspiration from previous work.\naggregate-level descriptions of song popularity, as labeled by our journalist, Silas Reed.

Your task is to help Silas create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information about Sailor’s past, her rise to stardom, and her influence."

From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\nUse your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.\n\nVisualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.\nUsing this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years."

    "text": "This exercise will target to answer one of the three challenges from VAST 2025 which features a fictitious island nation, Oceanus, famous for fishing and quiet seaside communities.\nThe chosen challenge is Mini-Challenge 1.\n\n\nOne of music’s biggest superstars is Oceanus native Sailor Shift. From humble beginnings, Sailor has grown in popularity and now enjoys fans around the world. Sailor started her career on the island nation of Oceanus which can be clearly seen in her early work, she started in the genre of “Oceanus Folk”. While Sailor has moved away from the traditional Oceanus style, the Oceanus Folk has made a name for itself in the musical world. The popularity of this music is one of the factors driving an increase in tourism to a quiet island nation that used to be known for fishing.\nIn 2023, Sailor Shift joined the Ivy Echoes – an all-female Oceanus Folk band consisting of Sailor (vocalist), Maya Jensen (vocalist), Lila “Lilly” Hartman (guitarist), Jade Thompson (drummer), and Sophie Ramirez (bassist). They played together at venues throughout Oceanus but had broken up to pursue their individual careers by 2026. Sailor’s breakthrough came in 2028 when one of her singles went viral, launched to the top of the global charts (something no other Oceanus Folk song had ever done). Since then, she has only continued to grow in popularity worldwide.\nSailor has released a new album almost every year since her big break, and each has done better than the last. Although she has remained primarily a solo artist, she has also frequently collaborated with other established artists, especially in the Indie Pop and Indie Folk genres. She herself has branched out musically over the years but regularly returns to the Oceanus Folk genre — even as the genre’s influence on the rest of the music world has spread even more.\nSailor has always been passionate about two things: (1) spreading Oceanus Folk, and (2) helping lesser-known artists break into music. Because of those goals, she’s particularly famous for her frequent collaborations.\nAdditionally, because of Sailor’s success, more attention began to be paid over the years to her previous bandmates. All 4 have continued in the music industry—Maya as an independent vocalist, Lilly and Jade as instrumentalists in other bands, and Sophie as a music producer for a major record label. In various ways, all of them have contributed to the increased influence of Oceanus folk, resulting in a new generation of up-and-coming Oceanus Folk artists seeking to make a name for themselves in the music industry.\nNow, as Sailor returns to Oceanus in 2040, a local journalist – Silas Reed – is writing a piece titled Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now that aims to trace the rise of Sailor and the influence of Oceanus Folk on the rest of the music world. He has collected a large dataset of musical artists, producers, albums, songs, and influences and organized it into a knowledge graph. Your task is to help Silas create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information about Sailor’s past, her rise to stardom, and her influence.\n\n\n\n\nDesign and develop visualizations and visual analytic tools that will allow Silas to explore and understand the profile of Sailor Shift’s career\n\nWho has she been most influenced by over time?\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\nHow has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\n\nDevelop visualizations that illustrate how the influence of Oceanus Folk has spread through the musical world.\n\nWas this influence intermittent or did it have a gradual rise?\nWhat genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\nOn the converse, how has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?\n\nUse your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.\n\nVisualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.\nUsing this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this exercise is from VAST 2025 MC1.\n\n\n\nGraph Description - Directed Multigraph - # nodes: 17,412 - # edges: 37, 857 - 18 connected components - Possible node types are: {Person, Song, RecordLabel, Album, MusicalGroup} - Possible edge types are: {MemberOf, PerformerOf, ComposerOf, ProducerOf, LyricistOf, InStyleOf, InterpolatesFrom, CoverOf, LyricalReferenceTo, DirectlySamples, RecordedBy, DistributedBy} - The graph format is a JSON file. The root-level JSON object consists of graph-level properties specifying that it is directed and a multigraph, a “nodes” key which holds the list of nodes, and a “links” key which holds the list of edges.\nThe data for this challenge comes from two different sources:\n\nan online, crowdsourced repository of musical influence, where contributors have manually notated instances in which songs or albums have sampled, covered, or otherwise drawn inspiration from previous work.\naggregate-level descriptions of song popularity, as labeled by our journalist, Silas Reed.

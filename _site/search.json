It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.",

The ggplot2 extension extension called patchwork  is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax for creating layouts super easily. The general syntax is:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus sign “+”\nParenthesis “()” to create a subplot group\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division design “/”\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combing Two ggplot2 Graphs\nThe figure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. The code and syntax used to create the plot simple!\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining Three ggplot2 Graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other\n“()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting\n\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a Composite Figure with Tagging\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake note that the tagging goes from top left -&gt; btm left -&gt; top right -&gt; btm right!\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating Figure with Insertion\nPatchwork allows more than just providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element(), one or several plots or graphic elements can be placed freely on top or below another plot.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2,\n                   left = 0.02,\n                   bottom = 0.7,\n                   right = 0.5,\n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a Composite Figure by Using patchwork and ggtheme\nThe figure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3 \npatchwork & theme_economist()",

They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same ID (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n3-2.4.1 Building an Animated Bubble Plot: ggplotly() Method\nIn this sub-section, an animated bubble plot will be created by using the ggplotly() method.\n\nNew Plot (without legend)CodeOriginal Plot (with legend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble plot above includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot. The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot.

Although the factor levels were arranged in ascending order, the use of coord_flip() in the plot reverses the axis orientation, resulting in Total being displayed in descending order as intended.\nSimilar to the reason above, the Sex variable was converted into a factor with levels set as Females first, followed by Males, such that it will appear as Males followed by Females in the stacked bar chart.\nggplot() was used with geom_bar() (with stat = “identity” and position = “stack”) to create a stacked horizontal bar chart (s1), displaying the Pop by Sex across PA.\ntheme_minimal() was applied for a clean visual style, and labs() with ggtitle() were used to customise the axis labels and plot title.\nscale_fill_manual() was used to assign distinct colours to Males and Females and to control the legend order, explicitly setting it as: Males → Females instead of the reversed order if left as default.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) was used to show numerical numbers rather than the scientific notation.\ntheme(legend.position = “bottom”) was used to move the legend position from the right to the bottom to allow the plot to be wider.\n\nZoomed-in Plot s2:\n\nA zoomed-in plot (s2) shows the bottom 10 PA and will be embedded into the main plot later. This method makes it easier to examine less populous PAs in the same figure.\nSince the zoomed-in plot (s2) will be overlaid on top of the main chart (s1), theme_test() was used to provide a contrast with the main s1 plot in the background.\nThe legend and background was removed using theme() and the axis titles were removed using labs() for a cleaner plot.\n\nZoom Rectangle:\n\nThis was created using cowplot() to be a transparent dotted line rectangle to allow highlighting of the zoomed-in location.\n\nOverlaid Plots:\n\nggdraw() was used to create an empty canvas, and draw_plot() was used to overlay s1, s2, and the zoom rectangles. All these functions are a part of the cowplot package.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Plots and Analysis\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npa_order &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  distinct(PA, Total) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Total) %&gt;%\n  pull(PA)\n\ndemography_sex &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PA = factor(PA, levels = pa_order),\n    Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c(\"Females\", \"Males\"))\n  )\n\ns1 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Planing Area\",\n    y = \"Population\",\n    fill = \"Sex\"\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Population Across Planning Areas by Sex\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\ndemography_sex_bottom10 &lt;- demography_sex %&gt;%\n  filter(PA %in% head(pa_order, 10))\n\ns2 &lt;- ggplot(data = demography_sex_bottom10, \n       aes(x = PA, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_test() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\"\n    ),\n    breaks = c(\"Males\", \"Females\")\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA)\n  )\n\nzoom_rect &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 1, ymin = 0, ymax = 1),\n            fill = NA, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  theme_void()\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(s1, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(s2, 0.4, 0.185, 0.56, 0.25) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.005, 0.155, 0.3, 0.206) +\n  draw_plot(zoom_rect, 0.37, 0.18, 0.62, 0.27) # (left , btm, right, top)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Populated\n\nTampines\nBedok\nSengkang\nJurong West\nWoodlands\n\n\n\n\nLeast Populated\n\nSeletar\nMuseum\nWestern Water Catchment\nSungei Kadut\nOrchard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nGender Ratio\n\nThe Sex distribution is generally balanced across all PAs.\n\n\n\nResidential Areas\n\nThe most populated PAs consists of a mix of mature estates (e.g., Tampines, Bedok) and newer estates (e.g, Sengkang, Jurong West, Woodlands) (Refer to Section 5 Appendix: Singapore’s Estate Classification\nThis reflects the government of Singapore’s success in transforming newer towns or underutilised land into well-developed residential hubs that are comparable to existing mature estates.\n\n\n\nCommercial / Industrial /Military Areas\n\nThe least populated PAs are primarily non-residential zones such as:\n\nCommercial: Museum, Orchard\nIndustrial: Sungei Kadut\nMilitary/Nature: Seletar (air base), Western Water Catchment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Reflections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nThe ggforce package includes the facet_zoom() function that allows for zooming in on a part of a plot and automatically draws a box to indicate the zoomed region.\nHowever, facet_zoom() does not support zooming in on discrete scales like the bottom 10 PAs in Pop.

This visualization aims to provide insight into Singapore’s Population pyramid and Gender distribution.\n\n3.3.1 Feature Engineering\nThe first part of the code aggregates the Population by Sex, and calculates the percentage of Males and Females by dividing it by the Total.\n\nThe next section prepares for adding labels to the pie chart. The label position (ypos) was calculated using cumulative percentages cumsum(Pct_Sex) - Pct_Sex / 2 since coord_polar(“y”) will be used to create the pie chart.\n\nThe next part of the code is for calculating the gender ratio. Violin plots are normalised to 1 by default so this ratio is needed to adjust the Male plot to be slightly smaller than the Female plot.\nIn the third part, the dataset was prepared to visualise Age distributions by Sex:\n\nThe dataset sg_data was grouped by Age and Sex, then summarised using sum(Pop) to get the population count for each Age-Sex group.\nThe resulting grouped data demography_sex_age was expanded into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop).\n\nThis transformation duplicates each row according to the Pop count, effectively simulating individual records. This is a requirement for plotting accurate violin plots of distributions.\n\n\nThe code below performs the steps above and finally splits the demography_sex_age data into two subsets (Males and Females) to allow overlaying their respective violin plots for easier visual comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# First Part\ntotal_by_sex &lt;- aggregate(Pop ~ Sex, data = sg_data, sum) %&gt;%\n    mutate(Total = sum(Pop))\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Pct_Sex = (Pop / Total) * 100) %&gt;%\n  select(Sex, Pct_Sex)\n\npct_total_by_sex &lt;- pct_total_by_sex %&gt;%\n  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Sex)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ypos = cumsum(Pct_Sex) -

30)\n\nMales consistently outnumber Females slightly till age 30.\nPopulation rises gradual from birth to age 8.\nA plateau is observed from ages 9 to 20, followed by another increase towards 30.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age 30 - 60)\n\nThe segment holds the largest proportion of Singapore’s population.\nFemales outnumber Males except for a brief period between age 57-65.\n\n\n\nPopulation Trends (Age Above 60)\n\nA steady decline beings from age 60 onward.\nThe Male population decreases at a faster rate, leading to a widening gender gap with increasing age.\n\n\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nThe age distribution resembles that of an ageing population which is consistent with other developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Reflections and Initial Workings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nI initially avoided expanding the data into individual-level observations using uncount(weights = Pop), since it is possible to pass weights = Pop in aes(). However, the resulting violin plot (below) looked weird. Therefore, I tried the uncount() method and found that these 2 methods produces very different plots. Upon further research, I found that while geom_violin() can estimate the probability density function (PDF) using the weights, density estimation with weights may be less precise or behave unexpectedly depending on implementation. Therefore, I chose to use uncount() in the final plot above, as working with raw, individual-level distributions seems to produce more accurate and visually realistic results.\n\n\nFeature Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemography_sex_age_2 &lt;- sg_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop))\n\ndemography_sex_age_2\n\n# A tibble: 182 × 3\n# Groups:   Age [91]\n     Age Sex       Pop\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     0 Females 14370\n 2     0 Males   15090\n 3     1 Females 15580\n 4     1 Males   16700\n 5     2 Females 17190\n 6     2 Males   17980\n 7     3 Females 17340\n 8     3 Males   18200\n 9     4 Females 19070\n10     4 Males   19880\n# ℹ 172 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots and Reflections\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=demography_sex_age_2, \n       aes(y = Age, \n           x= Sex,\n           weight = Pop,\n           fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"area\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sex\",\n    y = \"Age\",\n    title = \"Age Distribution by Sex\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Males\" = \"#88CCEE\",\n      \"Females\" = \"#CC6677\")\n    )",
